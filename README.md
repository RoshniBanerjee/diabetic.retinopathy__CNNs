Introduction
Out of the 30 papers we reviewed for this paper, 23 papers were using Machine Learning/Artificial Intelligence/or Deep Learning. Most of these models were reaching an accuracy of 95%+ with at least 4 hours of training. Hence, we knew a baseline of 75% with minimal training is an extremely good baseline. The TensorFlow model using a robust Keras Backend and OpenCV2 for raw image processing. This leads to feeding the raw images in a standard form to the TensorFlow backend where it can generate a model for training. After the model is trained and the correct classifiers are laid out by the CNN, for extracting its features, it is as simple as a Keras CV2 callback. This lets the CNN decide what is properties to extract, and since it has been trained long and accurately enough, the accuracy is extremely good, and the model is reliable.
